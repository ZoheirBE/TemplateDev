# XML Editor

A modern, web-based XML editor specifically designed for SWIFT message XML files. Built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, it provides a powerful IDE-like experience with real-time XSD validation and integrated documentation.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ IDE-style interface with multiple synchronized views
- âœ¨ Real-time XSD validation
- ðŸ“š Integrated documentation
- ðŸ”§ Powered by Monaco Editor
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ”„ Electron-based for cross-platform support

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Apply typescript best practices
- Use Powershell for terminal command
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix for components
- use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new shadcn components
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consider extension-specific constraints (popup dimensions, permissions)
- When adding new shadcn component, document the installation command

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Documentation
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Main Process (Electron)
- Handles file system operations
- Manages application windows
- Coordinates IPC communication

### Renderer Process (React)
- Implements the user interface
- Manages editor state
- Handles XML validation
- Provides real-time feedback

### Core Components

#### Editor Service
- Manages Monaco Editor instance
- Handles XML parsing and formatting
- Coordinates with validation service

#### Schema Service
- XSD schema loading and parsing
- Real-time validation
- Error reporting

#### IPC Service
- Manages communication between main and renderer processes
- Handles file operations
- Coordinates system events
