# XML Editor

A modern, web-based XML editor specifically designed for SWIFT message XML files. Built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, it provides a powerful IDE-like experience with real-time XSD validation and integrated documentation.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ IDE-style interface with multiple synchronized views
- âœ¨ Real-time XSD validation
- ðŸ“š Integrated documentation
- ðŸ”§ Powered by Monaco Editor
- ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- ðŸ”„ Electron-based for cross-platform support

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Apply typescript best practices
- Use Powershell for terminal command
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use path aliases for imports: `@/*` for src directory and `shared/*` for shared directory
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management
- Use React Context with TypeScript for type-safe state management
- Implement reducer pattern with discriminated union action types
- Maintain editor state with `EditorProvider` and `useEditor` hook
- Use singleton services for cross-component state (e.g., `SyncService`, `FileWatcherService`)
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks with return functions

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix for components
- use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new shadcn components
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
- Consider extension-specific constraints (popup dimensions, permissions)
- When adding new shadcn component, document the installation command

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Documentation
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
