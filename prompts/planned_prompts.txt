Here's a condensed plan with fewer but well-scoped prompts:

1. **Core Setup (1 prompt)**
- Electron + Vite infrastructure
- Basic file operations 
- Core types
- State management
- Events system

2. **Editor Implementation (1 prompt)**
- Monaco Editor setup
- XML validation
- XSLT transformations
- Schema handling

3. **Main UI (1 prompt)**
- Three-panel layout
- File explorer panel
- Properties panel
- Toolbar and status bar
- Dialogs

4. **Integration & Synchronization (1 prompt)**
- View synchronization
- Real-time updates
- File watching
- Error handling

This 4-prompt approach:
- Reduces complexity while maintaining logical separation
- Groups related functionality together
- Makes development more manageable
- Still allows for systematic validation
- Provides clearer dependencies between components

Each prompt can build on the previous ones, creating a more cohesive development flow.
